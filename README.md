# Playstore-Data-Analysis
📊This project was divided into two modules:

> 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing and Analysis

> 2️⃣ Data Visualization



📌Technology and Tools used in project: 

> Python (Numpy and Pandas) 

> Excel 

> SQL (MySQL) 

> PowerBI (For Visualization) 



The first module required us to clean the dataset using pandas and query it using SQL to gain insights from the database. The second module focused on generating insights through visualization by using both datasets to understand what the numbers in and behind the data want to convey. We also had to create videos of both the modules. Here are the links to access them:
